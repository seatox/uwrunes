Warning: Pre-alpha minecraft mod.  Mess with at your own risk.

Once the mod is installed, working and you're in the game -

First, you need to get some gold ingots.  Not bars, ingots.  Break up a regular gold bar, or go hunting zombie pigmen.

You're then going to need to cook some cobblestone into smoothstone.

A single gold ingot surrounded by smoothstone,

 X 
X,X
 X 

gets you a blank rune.

You'll then need to make a Runebag and an Ankh.

The runebag is made from wool, string and a single blank rune.

Pattern:

SSS
WrW
WWW

S = String
W = Wool
r = rune

The runebag can hold blank and "attuned" runes, and is also your spellcasting tool.  To open it's storage, sneak-right-click
while holding it.  The three slots at the bottom of the Runebag UI are where attuned runes are arranged to change the spell
cast when you use the bag normally.

The Ankh is the block used to attune runes to each of the Words Of Magic and also for spending experience to increase
your spellcasting circle.

It's made thus:
 n
nrn
 n

n = gold nugget
r = blank rune

So, by the numbers you need 5 nuggets for the ankh, and 1 for the runebag.  If you're starting with a single gold bar
that leaves you with enough for 4 more blank runes to attune.


Attuning runes

The valid Words Of Magic are:
AN, BET, CORP, DES, EX, FLAM, GRAV, HUR, IN, JUX, KAL, LOR, MANI
NOX, ORT, POR, QUAS, REL, SANCT, TYM, UUS, VAS, WIS, XEN, YLEM, ZU

Stick a blank rune into the Ankh, enter the word and press enter (or click the icon once I sort the UI out for the ankh).
You'll get a rune of that Word.

Sneak-right-click the rune bag, and arrange the runes in the right order for one of the spells, and then, if you have the mana
level needed and your circle is high enough you'll cast the spell.
